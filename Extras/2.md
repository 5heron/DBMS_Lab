);
```

### 2. Faculty Table

SELECT * 
FROM FACULTY 
WHERE SALARY >= ALL (SELECT SALARY FROM FACULTY);
```

### 2. Get Names of Faculty Teaching in Semester 5

```sql
SELECT NAME 
FROM FACULTY F
JOIN TEACHING T ON F.FNO = T.FNO
WHERE T.SEMESTER = 5;
```

### 3. Get Course Details for CS Department with 3 Credits

```sql
SELECT CNO, CNAME 
FROM COURSE C
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON C.ODNO = D.DNO
WHERE D.DNAME = 'CS' AND C.CREDITS = 3;
```

### 4. Get Names of Faculty Teaching 3 or Fewer Courses

```sql
SELECT NAME 
FROM FACULTY 
WHERE FNO IN (
    SELECT F.FNO 
    FROM FACULTY F
    JOIN TEACHING T ON F.FNO = T.FNO
    GROUP BY F.FNO 
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 3
);
```

### 5. Get Department and Course Count

- **With Department Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT D.DNO, D.DNAME, COUNT 
   FROM DEPARTMENT D
   JOIN (
       SELECT D1.DNO, COUNT(C.CNO) AS COUNT 
       FROM DEPARTMENT D1
       JOIN COURSE C ON D1.DNO = C.ODNO
       GROUP BY D1.DNO
   ) D1 ON D1.DNO = D.DNO;
   ```

- **Without Department Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT D1.DNO, COUNT(C.CNO) AS COUNT 
   FROM DEPARTMENT D1
   JOIN COURSE C ON D1.DNO = C.ODNO
   GROUP BY D1.DNO;
   ```

## 📝 PL/SQL Program

This PL/SQL program fetches details of faculty members whose salary is above the average salary.

```plsql
DECLARE
    CURSOR cur IS 
        SELECT * 
        FROM FACULTY 
        WHERE SALARY > (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM FACULTY);
    
    fno FACULTY.FNO%TYPE;
    name FACULTY.NAME%TYPE;
    gender FACULTY.GENDER%TYPE;
    age FACULTY.AGE%TYPE;
    salary FACULTY.SALARY%TYPE;
    dnum FACULTY.DNUM%TYPE;
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('FNO' || ' | ' || 'NAME' || ' | ' || 'GENDER' || ' | ' || 'AGE' || ' | ' || 'SALARY' || ' | ' || 'DNUM');
    
    OPEN cur;
    IF cur%ISOPEN THEN
        LOOP
            FETCH cur INTO fno, name, gender, age, salary, dnum;
            EXIT WHEN cur%NOTFOUND;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(fno || ' | ' || name || ' | ' || gender || ' | ' || age || ' | ' || salary || ' | ' || dnum);
        END LOOP;
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Cursor did not open.');
    END IF;
    
    CLOSE cur;
END;
