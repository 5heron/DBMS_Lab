# University Database Operations

This section contains SQL queries for modifying and querying the university database, including operations on `DEPARTMENT`, `FACULTY`, and `COURSE` tables, as well as a PL/SQL function to check for Armstrong numbers.

## 🗂️ Table Details and Constraints

### View Table Constraints

Retrieves constraint names, types, and table names for specified tables.

```sql
SELECT constraint_name, constraint_type, table_name
FROM user_constraints
WHERE table_name IN ('DEPARTMENT', 'FACULTY', 'COURSE');
```

## 🔄 Data Manipulation Queries

1. **Update Salary for Male Faculty Over 50**

    ```sql
    UPDATE faculty
    SET salary = salary * 1.10
    WHERE age > 50 AND gender = 'M';
    ```

2. **Rename `salary` Column in `FACULTY` Table**

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE faculty
    RENAME COLUMN salary TO faculty_salary;
    ```

3. **Select Department Name with Highest Faculty Salary**

    ```sql
    SELECT dname
    FROM faculty, department
    WHERE dnum = dno
      AND faculty_salary IN (SELECT MAX(faculty_salary) FROM faculty);
    ```

4. **Select Departments with More Than 2 Courses**

    ```sql
    SELECT dname
    FROM department
    WHERE dno IN (
        SELECT dno
        FROM department, course
        WHERE dno = odno
        GROUP BY dno
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
    );
    ```

5. **List Departments and Number of Courses Ordered by Course Count**

    ```sql
    SELECT dname, no_courses
    FROM department d, (
        SELECT COUNT(cno) AS no_courses, dno
        FROM department, course
        WHERE dno = odno
        GROUP BY dno
    ) n
    WHERE n.dno = d.dno
    ORDER BY no_courses;
    ```

## 📝 PL/SQL Function

This function checks if a number is an Armstrong number.

### Function Definition

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION armstrong (num IN NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER AS
    dig NUMBER;
    sum1 NUMBER := 0;
    len NUMBER;
    numcpy NUMBER := num;
BEGIN
    len := LENGTH(TO_CHAR(num));
    WHILE (numcpy > 0) LOOP
        dig := MOD(numcpy, 10);
        numcpy := TRUNC(numcpy / 10);
        sum1 := sum1 + POWER(dig, len);
    END LOOP;

    IF sum1 = num THEN
        RETURN 1;
    ELSE
        RETURN 0;
    END IF;
END;
/
```

### Test the Function

```sql
DECLARE
    num NUMBER := &number;
    result NUMBER;
BEGIN
    result := armstrong(num);
    IF result = 1 THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(num || ' is an Armstrong number');
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(num || ' is not an Armstrong number');
    END IF;
END;
/
```
