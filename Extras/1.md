# Database Setup and Queries

This project involves creating tables, running queries, and developing a trigger.

## 📝 Table Creation

### 1. `DEPARTMENT` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE department (
    dept_id    NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name  VARCHAR(15),
    manager_id NUMBER,
    location   VARCHAR(10)
);
```

### 2. `EMPLOYEE` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id    NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name  VARCHAR(15),
    hire_date DATE,
    salary    NUMBER,
    dept_id   NUMBER REFERENCES department(dept_id)
);
```

### Foreign Key Constraint

```sql
ALTER TABLE department
ADD CONSTRAINT manager_id_fk FOREIGN KEY (manager_id)
REFERENCES employee(emp_id);
```

## 🔍 Queries

### 3. Employees with 'U' in Their Name

```sql
SELECT emp_name, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE emp_name LIKE '%U%';
```

### 4. Employees in the Same Department as 'Tomy'

```sql
SELECT emp_name, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE dept_id = (
    SELECT dept_id
    FROM employee
    WHERE emp_name = 'Tomy'
);
```

### 5. Employees Earning Above Average Salary (Sorted by Salary)

```sql
SELECT emp_id, emp_name
FROM employee
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employee
)
ORDER BY salary;
```

### 6. Departments with More Than 2 Employees

```sql
SELECT d.dept_name
FROM department d
WHERE d.dept_id IN (
    SELECT dept_id
    FROM employee e
    GROUP BY e.dept_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
);
```

### 7. Least Experienced Employee's Details with Manager Name

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, m.emp_name AS manager_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
JOIN employee m ON d.manager_id = m.emp_id
WHERE e.hire_date = (
    SELECT MAX(hire_date)
    FROM employee
);
```

## ⚠️ Trigger for Salary Increment Warning

### Trigger Definition

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER salary_increment_warning
BEFORE UPDATE OF salary ON employee
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    increment employee.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    increment := :new.salary - :old.salary;
    IF (increment > 10000) THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Warning! Salary increment is higher than 10000');
    END IF;
END;
/
```

### Test Update Query

```sql
UPDATE employee SET salary = 75000 WHERE emp_id = 1;
-- Output: Warning! Salary increment is higher than 10000
-- 1 row updated.
-- Commit complete.
```
