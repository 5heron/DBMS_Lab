# Faculty and Department Database

This project defines tables for a university's faculty, department, and courses. It also includes SQL queries for data manipulation and a PL/SQL block to retrieve the top 5 highest-paid faculty members.

## üóÇÔ∏è Table Creation

### 1. `DEPARTMENT` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE department (
    dno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dname VARCHAR(20),
    dphone INT
);
```

### 2. `FACULTY` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE faculty (
    fno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(10),
    gender VARCHAR(1),
    age INT,
    salary INT,
    dnum INT REFERENCES department(dno)
);
```

### 3. `COURSE` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE course (
    cno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(20),
    credits INT,
    dno INT REFERENCES department(dno)
);
```

## üîÑ Data Manipulation Queries

1. **Rename Column in `COURSE` Table**

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE course RENAME COLUMN credits TO total_credits;
    ```

2. **Retrieve Faculty Names Starting with 'J_m%' and Their Department Names**

    ```sql
    SELECT name, dname
    FROM faculty, department
    WHERE name LIKE 'J_m%' AND dnum = dno;
    ```

3. **Calculate Average Salary of Male Faculty in 'CS' Department**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
    FROM faculty, department
    WHERE gender = 'M' AND dnum = dno AND dname = 'CS';
    ```

4. **Get Departments with More Than 2 Courses**

    ```sql
    SELECT dname, COUNT(cno) AS course_cnt
    FROM department, course
    WHERE dno = dno
    GROUP BY dno
    HAVING COUNT(cno) > 2;
    ```

5. **Find Department Names Offering Both 'OS' and 'DBMS' Courses**

    ```sql
    SELECT dname
    FROM department, course
    WHERE cname = 'OS' AND dno = dno
      AND dname IN (
          SELECT dname
          FROM department, course
          WHERE cname = 'DBMS' AND dno = dno
      );
    ```

## üìù PL/SQL Block

Retrieves the top 5 highest-paid faculty members.

```sql
DECLARE
    CURSOR sal_cur IS
        SELECT fno, name, salary
        FROM FACULTY
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;

    fnum   FACULTY.fno%TYPE;
    fname  FACULTY.name%TYPE;
    sal    FACULTY.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN sal_cur;
    LOOP
        FETCH sal_cur INTO fnum, fname, sal;
        EXIT WHEN sal_cur%NOTFOUND;
        
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Faculty no: ' || fnum || ', Name: ' || fname || ', Salary: ' || sal);
    END LOOP;
    
    CLOSE sal_cur;
END;
/
```

## üöÄ Execute PL/SQL Block

```sql
EXECUTE sal_cur;
```
